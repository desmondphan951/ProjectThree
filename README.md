# Project Outline 

(Wine Supply Chain Blockchain)

One of the most common question whenever we consumer any wine product is "Where does the wine come from ?" Traditional approach is often inefficiencies and rigidity, which makes it difficult for users to track the original source of wine. Further challenges include wine counterfeit or illegal production that are negatively impact the industry: It is estimated that 20% of all wine currently circulating the globe is fake (which is in line with all luxury goods) and it’s not just rare wines that are impacted, some ‘commercial’, household labels and wines are now also being counterfeited. These biggest challenges that are facing wine supply chain today can be overcomed by the implementation of Blockchain technology.

Our group (Group Name) main objective is to provide an innovative solution using Blockchain to tackle this issue. Our main idea is to connect these following stakeholders directly, include:
* Grape-grower
* Producers
* Distributors/Wholesalers
* Consumers (End-Users)

Using the main feature of Blockchain, which are traceability, security, and decentralisation when dealing with data around the wine supply chain. Transactions that have been carried out will be store to different nodes where all users are able to access and view it, which certainly cereate a  transparent environment that no parties are able to intervene it.

# Project Details

Here how our blockchain works:

1. Grape-grower - First user, will store the information about the wine on the blockchain, using the mobile app. They can also upload the pictures of the wine, which are proccessed to the Blockchain, to make informed decision about the quality of the wine.

2. Producers - after receiving wine items from the Farmers, the producers can then store the information related to the refining of wine on the public blockchain. Information stored on the Blockchain will help retailers and consumers verify the authenticity of the wine. 

3. Distributors - Once the wine is processed, the wine will be distributed, where the distributors will update the transportation details on the blockchain. The information related to temperature or real-time location of the wine items will also be sent to the blockchain.

4.Distributors/Wholesalers - From source to destination, the user is able to capture all the information to ensure the wine is safe or not by back tracing the wine items from the Blockchain.
