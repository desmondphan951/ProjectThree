# Project Outline 

(Food Supply Chain Blockchain)

One of the most common question whenever we consumer any food product is "Where does the food come from ?" Traditional approach is often inefficiencies and rigidity within the industry that makes it difficult for users to track the original source of food. Further challenges include food fraud, foodborne illness, or illegal production. These biggest challenges that are facing food supply chain today can be overcomed by the implementation of Blockchain technology.

Our group (Group Name) main objective is to provide an innovative solution using Blockchain to tackle this issue. Our main idea is to connect these following stakeholders directly, include:
* Farmers
* Producers
* Distributors/Wholesalers
* Retailers
* End Users/the Consumers

Using the main feature of Blockchain, which are traceability, security, and decentralisation when dealing with data around the food supply chain. Transactions that have been carried out will be store to different nodes where all users are able to access and view it, which certainly cereate a  transparent environment that no parties are able to intervene it.

# Project Details

Here how our blockchain works:

1. Farmers - First user, will store the information about the food on the blockchain, using the mobile app. They can also upload the pictures of the food, which are proccessed to the Blockchain, to make informed decision about the quality of the food.

2. Producers - after receiving food items from the Farmers, the producers can then store the information related to the refining of food on the public blockchain. Information stored on the Blockchain will help retailers and consumers verify the authenticity of the food. 

3. Distributors - Once the food is processed, the food will be distributed, where the distributors will update the transportation details on the blockchain. The information related to temperature or real-time location of the food items will also be sent to the blockchain.

4.Retailers - After the food is delivered to retailer,  

5.Consumers - From source to destination, the user is able to capture all the information to ensure the food is safe or not by back tracing the food items from the Blockchain.
